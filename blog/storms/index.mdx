### Hurricane Grace Puerto Morelos, Mexico

On August 20, 2021, I experienced my second hurricane while living in Puerto Morelos. These [pictures](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1232053.shtml) pretty much tell the story of what is was like. I lost power for 3 days so I got a lot of time to sleep!

I am now in San Francisco and experienced another storm!
